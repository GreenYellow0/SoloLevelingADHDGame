⚔️ Solo Leveling System — The App
🔍 What Is It?
Imagine turning your daily life and personal goals into a video game — inspired by the anime Solo Leveling. That’s exactly what this app does.

This is your personal System — a game-like interface that helps you track progress, challenge yourself, and celebrate every small win. It’s built for motivation, not perfection.



🧠 Core Mechanics
The app transforms daily tasks into quests. Complete them, and you earn rewards — just like in a game.



🧬 1. Growth: From Weakest to Strongest
Your progress is tracked through stats and currency:

📈 Experience Points (XP) & Level: Every completed task gives XP. Leveling up shows your dedication over time.

💰 Currency (Points, Gold, Silver): Completing quests earns you in-game currency. Use it to unlock items, rank up, or reward yourself.



🧭 2. Quests: The Path Forward
Your life becomes a series of quests with real structure.

🗓️ Daily & Physical Quests: Simple, recurring tasks like brushing teeth, stretching, or taking meds. They reset at midnight and help build consistent routines.

🧹 Special Quests: Bigger challenges (like cleaning or going for a walk) that change every 3 days. They break monotony and offer better rewards.

🔥 Streaks: Complete daily quests multiple days in a row to unlock massive bonus rewards. This is the main way to earn rare Gold.



🌀 3. Gates & Mining: Active and Passive Engagement
Something to do when you’ve got energy — and something for when you don’t.

🎯 Gates (The Hunt)
Timed, randomized challenges you can accept based on your Rank:

F/E/D Gates: Easy tasks like “do 5 push-ups.” Lower XP/gold, common material drops like Designs and Low-tier Mana Crystals.

A/S/S++ Gates: Harder mental or physical tasks like “meditate 20 minutes.” Bigger rewards and rarer materials like Marks of Time.



🧱 Idle Mining (Passive Income)
Start a mining timer (2–10 minutes). Once done, claim Low-tier Mana Crystals. Simple, passive progress to fuel your Trading Post.



🏦 4. The Economy: Reward Yourself
Everything you earn has meaning.

⬆️ Rank Up: Use Points to level up your Rank (F → S++). Higher ranks permanently boost your XP and Points gain.

🛍️ Shop & Weapon Collection: Spend your currency on collectible weapons tied to your rank. Completing the full collection unlocks a major endgame reward.

🏗️ Trading Post: Trade materials from Gates and Mining for XP, Gold, or Silver — and loop back into stronger quests.



🌟 Final Goal
The goal isn’t to chase perfection — it’s to turn life into an adventure.

Whether you're battling procrastination or building habits, this app helps you measure your effort, celebrate your wins, and keep growing.

You’re the main character in this story — and with every quest, you get stronger.
