This is a personal tool built for ADHD — designed to transform everyday tasks into quests using the gamified style of Solo Leveling.

It helps with motivation, structure, and self-discipline by making the daily grind feel like a path to becoming stronger. The interface and mechanics mimic the in-world “System” from the Solo Leveling universe — quests, ranks, XP, points, gold, and even timed challenges like Gates.

🧠 How to Use
This system is built for personal use — to make habit-building more engaging. To use it for yourself:

Customize the quests — both Daily and Physical

Adjust rewards — XP, Points, Gold/Silver to match your own difficulty scale

Optional: Customize rank names, weapon inventory, or Gate logic

No account, no server. All progress is saved locally via JSON.

🛠 Requirements
A modern web browser (desktop or mobile)

Basic familiarity with editing HTML/JS if you want to tweak deeper logic

Self-awareness and brutal honesty with yourself — this is your system, not a game

⚠️ Note
This is not a public app or service. It’s a self-crafted personal tool for someone walking their own path, fighting their own battles. If you want to use or adapt it, do so with care — and reshape it into something that serves you.
